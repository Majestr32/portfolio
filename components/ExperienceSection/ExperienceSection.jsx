            I received a work proposal from a friend of a friend who was
            launching a startup and needed an MVP developed quickly. I completed
            the project within a few days, exceeding expectations and impressing
            the client. He recommended me to another company, where I was
            invited to join a project without an interview after identifying and
            resolving issues in their app and helping them meet tight deadlines.
            My responsibility include planning & developing new features and
            maintaining app.

            After gaining experience on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, my
            freelance partner and I decided to transition to direct client
            interactions. We established our own website to connect with clients
            more efficiently. I have had tons of experience in leadership,
            mostly doing project management, testing, describing architecture
            and helping team to deliver projects in time, also keeping them
            motivated.

            One of my clients, a skilled backend developer and entrepreneur,
            invited me to work on his company’s products after being impressed

            Freelancing as a game developer was a challenging but rewarding
            journey. Initially, I focused on learning and improving my skills
            rather than heavily promoting my services. My freelance partner
            introduced me to mobile app projects, which led to my involvement in
            approximately 12 diverse projects.

            My journey began with C++, a language I still admire. During
            university, I transitioned to C# and rediscovered my passion for
            creating online games. This led me to explore Unity, where I started
            building prototypes and honing my game development skills. Also, I
            have created and launched my first game, which was “Shape Chopper”
            hypercasual game with website for android, it was removed from store
            on April 2024 due to lack of updates.
